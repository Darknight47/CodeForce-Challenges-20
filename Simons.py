For a permutation∗ r of length m, we call an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ m) ugly if and only if i=max({r1,r2,…,ri}).

Simons has a permutation p of length n, and he can perform the following operation on p at most once:

Choose two indices i and j (1≤i≠j≤n), then swap pi and pj.
Find a permutation q that can be obtained from p by performing the above operation at most once, such that the number of ugly indices in q is minimized.

∗ A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, 
but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) — the length of p.

The second line contains n integers p1,p2,…,pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ n, all pi-s are distinct) — the elements of p.

Output
For each test case, print n integers q1,q2,…,qn — the permutation you found.

If there are multiple possible permutations, you may output any.
